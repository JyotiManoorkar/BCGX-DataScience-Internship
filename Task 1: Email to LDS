Hi [LDS],

To test if customers leave because of prices, we need to study how likely they are to leave based on prices. We need certain information to do this:

Details about customers, like what industry they're in, how much electricity they usually use, and when they became customers.
Information about whether customers have left or not.
Past prices for electricity and gas that the company has charged customers, broken down by time.
Once we have this data, we can create new characteristics based on it and make a model to predict if customers will leave or not. 
We can use models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosted Machines. 
We'll choose the best model by balancing how complex it is, how well it explains things, and how accurate it is. 
With the chosen model, we can see how much prices affect whether customers leave, and how important prices are compared to other factors. 
Also, we can figure out how much the company's discount plan might affect its business.
